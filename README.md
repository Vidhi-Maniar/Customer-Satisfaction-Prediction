Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict Customer Satisfaction Ratings based on customer support ticket data. It includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

Dataset

- File: customer_support_tickets.csv
- Contains support tickets with features like:
  - Customer demographics (Age, Gender),
  - Ticket details (Type, Priority, Status, Channel),
  - Product info,
  - Time metrics (Response and Resolution time),
  - Satisfaction Rating (1‚Äì5).

---

Goals

- Predict customer satisfaction using ML models,
- Explore trends in support issues and customer behavior,
- Identify factors affecting satisfaction,
- Visualize insights from the data.

---

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Includes visualizations of:
- Age distribution,
- Satisfaction ratings by gender,
- Ticket types vs satisfaction,
- Ticket trends over time.

Machine Learning

- Model: Random Forest Classifier,
- Preprocessing: Label encoding, feature scaling, missing value handling,
- Evaluation: Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix,
- Feature Importance: Ticket Type, Priority, and Age were key predictors.
